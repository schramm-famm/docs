Got persistance and concurency working!
Are we docking these? Yes 

Got the cursor sort of working but it was a TASK, Thao/Igor implemented the versioning of the patches v exciting!
Idea of the ACK just came up. We might have thought of it but then decided we wouldn't need it. we have to make sure that the 
patch buffer gets cleared when too big.

We were able to check off some of the points 

Few issues with testing conversationsj
made test code and more code to test that code.

need to work on design/implementation of the cursor movements and design. Need to figure out how text editable works and then 
we can go from there.

Cursor persistance is a bigger goal. Hard to think of evry single use case. Need another design meeting for cursor persistance design

we do wanna get the other services connected, but also want the core connections. Whole system integrated vs core functionality.

Technically the report is due next week, she would rather use use our momentum to do the work, and we already have a structure for our information

It takes a while to write a document. Diagrams usually pump things up. Think of Esfendiari. we want a continual flow. We should

is a formalist. Don't mention something in chap. 1 that is never mentionned again. Health safety, we can talk about security in that respect. it's a mandatory 
chapter. Then there's a break down of the work. We had the big picture, now we need the details
