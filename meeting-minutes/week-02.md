# Week 2 Minutes

Progress update: proposal is completed.

One more draft round of the project. 

What now? 

Thao looking into Vagrant and 
Igor was looking at react and Github action which we are waiting for the beta for, good for CI. 
Honor looked at other projects similar to ours-> OneNote 
Riley - setting up new laptop

Figuring out the balance of mess vs usefullness of the messaging format
  - Decided against drawings
  
We can be compiling tutorials and READMEs all year long so that the final report is more compilation than writing. 
Sum up everything that we read

Spend next 1/2 weeks exploring

Exploration should be guided.

The first barebones version will be the backend. Encorporating the existing library for the diff patch, 
setting up database, how we will be storing database long term. Store diff or certain amount of history etc.

We will need Use cases, schema, design in addition to the coding --> Test Driven Development 

Keep going with our research. 

Choice: 1. Take formal approach: map it all out or 2. Explore in paralell to developing the use case diagrams 

*In 2/3/4 Weeks have use cases*

Next Meeting: 
* Have a demo of technologies. (If we are ready). A verbal demo and then a one pager.
* Be able to ask any questions about the proposal comments.
