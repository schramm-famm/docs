* Put database schema in detail slides
  * Go deeper with detail slides
* Free-form sequence diagram
  * Show contribution to more than just installing
  * Show unified product on top of microservices
* Maybe go into detail into different AWS services, compared to how they would traditionally run
  * It should definitely be in the report! and the presentation time permitting
* For testing give concrete examples of each time of testing, again the note is to give concrete examples. 
  * Show pipeline flow and a unit test
  * Also, how will we be performing stress testing? Calling the API calls directly, see how it performs with 1M calls
  * SHould we include stress testing tool? As 
  * Load vs Stress Testing? Load testing is done constantly to handle normal load, stress testing is for high traffic events. (ex black friday)
  * What is performance testing, unit testing.
  * Load testing what are we measuring? Latency? Come up with mock examples that force us to come up with answers to these tests.
  * Performance testing is functionality. Load is testing responsiveness.
  * 20 people in a conversation vs 1000 people signing in. We need to sit down and think of these questions. 
* Convey sense of depth and acomplishment rather than ideas. "We have done..." instead of "We want to..."
* Next steps, talk about division of work between people. Plan it out in the slides. So we know what to do on Feb 1st.
* What we already have is v general and apple pie. If you explain we're using Agile, explain how we are implementing that (2 week sprints, show the kan ban board on the slide!)
* Show don't tell!
* Break down UI design & development, talk about the mini-map, mock up images of the mini-map.
* For the breakdown, explain how we're gonna do it, could be certain people with certain aspects, but also pick the next issue off the top.
  * Talk about how we've each taken a part, and that we want to move away from that. 
  
* Show evidence of a plan, not about holding us to anything. 
* Will second reader ask questions as we go? No, generally no, they know we've practiced. They will be writing. Very gentle.
* Some questions are probing and some have a message, we should record them.
* Don't agree with everything. Acknowlege the idea, and talk about whether or not it fits in our scope and alligns with our objectives.
* What's social about this? The notifications, @'ting people (**TALK ABOUT THIS**) circle around to whta social means. Examples of images? Yes, outline challenges.
* What's hard about images, it's in the uploading, so we made the service for it which stores it in S3 buckets.
* Could talk about the run through of the MS scenario right after intro of MS acrchitecture.
* Script out the demo, Show adding, deleting, and copy/paste, backwards editing. Quick but informative, all about context. 
* Acknowledge our UI, and maybe then talk about the mock ups of what the UI will (hopefully be)
* Consider the reason why we are doing the presentation, this is about marking our work that we've done so far. 
* 2nd reader will be able to cope with the detail, he will like it and want to know more about the specifics. 
* We won't meet next week, our time is at 3:45
