What did we get out of the presentation:
  * We did well with cohesion and circling back to main principles.
  * Good feedback on microservices vs monolith
  * Good feedback on patches and Google Wave
  * Gave us confidence in our design.
  
Now the challenge is to implement, meet his challenge, show that design time was worth it.

Now just buckle down and get the work done.

That's where we're going to meet our goals.

2 week sprints. We've just been planning out our sprint. We made good progress in this sprint.

* Igor: Conversations service basically done, working on unit tests
* Thao: Implemented CRUD APIs for preferences, figuring out aws stuff on terraform. 
  Igor learned a lot in prelim steps, now Thao's building off that, services will get easier and easier.
  Working on logs right now, can't tell when deployment didn't work. So this will be beneficial will 
* Honor: CRUD and filtering. Need to come up with proper filtering roles. Not using heroic, using timescale db.
  Heroic is metric focused, datatype in numbers. Timescale is built upon prostgres, it's a lot easier.
* Riley: Users, CRUD operations

Pheonix Pay system? monolith? they dropped necessary functionality due to timing and 20% of the tests weren't passing. 
They contracted IBM but it was too much, so then they payed them to train gov employees, how does IBM feel?

Thought from another group, March 9th is draft of final report. (it's movable between us and Schramm) It's a message that 
writting takes time. Report would happen if our design changes and we need to take a pause. Deadline for code is when we 
submit our report, after poster fair (should be just refactoring). Poster fair is the 20th of March. It has been the 12th.

When we submitted to ncure, we were 8th and they only took 7. There is a bus trip to Queen's. We can just reuse the poster from 
the fair. We should just say we need the standard 2 tables and request a monitor or television. Get it in early.

The only challenge we have is to put in the time and deliver.

The unexpected hiccups that will trip us up.

does carleton have a megnetometer? ask prof steele. she has a ti board with that from 3310
