Catching up on the week:
* Igor changed to using web sockets from server sent events
* Thao made the events out of json
* Riley did the cursor persistance

Non server sent goal is for web sockets work better for our situation.


Goals security wise:
* User authentication
* encrypting messages being sent
* secure mode? like fb messenger
* Only concern is overhead

We now have to look into architectural concerns

more features? Formatting? Maybe use xml

Database -> we want to implement version control
* Do a few key scenarios and let that drive the design discussions

Look into the minimap a bit, even though it would be UI heavy

What sets us apart:
* minimap
* multimedia -> need to look into.  _do some scenarios_ 


Get into planning the database

What does social mean? Nail down some concepts. Demonstrate a couple of options


**hand writing


* Links would be a good feature to have

* Locking certain blocks

* pinned 

* Locked privileges for documents

* export to pdf? html file?

* drawing box

* 



For next week:

* exploring the cloud - if we need to pay for cloud services, let Cheryl know.

* database conceptualization


Future:

* Regroup and co-aless on the design
* Coherant design of the database
