# Week 2 Meeting Minutes

Update: 

Reminder for next week: bring HDMI Cable

Thao: Got environment set up in vagrant

Igor: got basic version of application up an running. Server in go, js client.

Riley: Dummy-proofed the read.me

We all use every environment and run in vagrant so we're a great test group.

We still want to knock off a diff function first before calling this a milestone.

We should define milestones -> Agile

Riley can start creating stories and issues! 

Thao discussed continuous feedback in a pseudo-agile environment
  * There were difficulties in situations where stories were completed but deemed
    "incomplete" when customers were unhappy.
  * Thao had an incident of being contacted on a day off by a team in India
  * People at Ciena would offer to be online for the weekend
  
She also had an experience with a mature and structured team (at the same company)

Igor discussed working with a true Agile environment in his company
  * Stories were set in stone months in advance
  * There was almost no interations with customers so the same issues weren't faced
  * Igor had an on-call schedule for people that would be called on when they're off
    for only senior engineers
    
 Work for this week:
 * Establish Milestones
 * Set some bigger goals for pre-midterm season.
 * Diff is the next big milestone (experimentally)
 * Schedule another design meeting to figure out the diff.
 * Week after reading week to cement the design.
 * Igor's done. Time to pick up the slack kids.
 
### Reminder for next week: Bring HDMI so we can use the TV
