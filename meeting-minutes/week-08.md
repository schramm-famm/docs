We worked on requirements:
  * Figureing out roles of users in conversations
  * Figured out general mini-map requirements 
  * Figured out how we were storing the history of our conversations


Are we seeing how to divide and conquer? Yes, helps with general understanding and microservices have helped that.

Progress report:

  * Internal document: can use requirements! with progress reports
  * 2 parts: 
      * 1. Challenges met (ah-ha moments)/ contributions so far. It is good to speak generally but also specify people when talking about specifics
      * 2. What we're planning for next term.
  * This feeds into our presentation, it should be a strong start in january.
  * She will resend an link about the proposal, has outline for progress report
  * Requirements, portions of design and db scheme. Then contributuions and plan
  * Presentation: this is what we're doing, this is what we've done, and this is what will be done.
  * No expectations of the demo, talk about reqs and what will be met by the poster fair. We have enough to do a demo.
  * Doesn't need to be submitted in advance, as it's just used internally.
  * Should be mostly useful to us. Make sure we're having the open conversations.
  * Less of a marking event, more of a tool.

We're in a good place!

We will be talking 10 mins each then 20 mins of Qs

Take note of their questions and make sure that they're answered for the final poster fair.
