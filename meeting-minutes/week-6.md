HDMI Cable success!

Updates: 
* Honor got rte working. Doesn't work the exact same way as Microsoft word. 
  Instead of XML we used HTML!
  
* New text box! new HTML element. It's a div which inserts the bold/italics/underlined tags
  There are a few issues with them which we need to wrap and then handle. 
  
* Colours -> should be similar, will probably have to insert CSS styling.
  
* aws was decided on, because of familiarity. Diagram was created for load balancing.
  This will be good in the future to give technical bg.
  
* Authorization, using go wt. Should try sooner rather than later. 2 factor authentication?

* Gerenral schema was set up at sandbox/issues/4
  Need to think about what constitues a patch. Currently: insert/delete character, insert/delete pasted/selected.
  Roles are what we're thinking of doing: 
  
* Can you have 2 conversations open on the same tab? We were thinking of a sidebar.

What's next, what are the uh-ohs?

Honor keep working on rte

Igor and Thao aws architecture

Riley aws stuff, helping Honor, designing the UI?

UI will be one page, similar to slack.

How do we store a session variable? probably best not to save previous position.

* Caching is something to look into, could be an uh-oh.



Think about where you want to be in January: you want design done and some implementaiton

* have aws set up
* have authentication set up
* have some scenarios that demonstrate using the schemas in the cloud.
  Demonstrate that the design works in the scenarios.
  
  
Igor - aws
Thao - authorization
Honor - RTE
Riley - db stuff, figuring out wrappers for different commands.
