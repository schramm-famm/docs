What we did

* Igor started setting up aws. Deciding between kubernetes and build in aws load balancer. 
* Thao authentication and creation of the token "heimdall" gateway to other services. Determines authenticatino required for requested route
  Wrote a few unit tests. Also verified that Heimdall can validate tokens and that containers can communicate with eachother.
* Riley worked on Karen, User account interface service.
* Honor added colouring and highlighting. db cleaning, looking at it as an ideal thing to have. could be an on the fly thing or retroactive. Only affects storage
  highlighting is forever!
  
Each microservice has its own database, so each service can utilize its own db tech, only con is that it's maybe slower. 


Internal demos are on Mondays! Sprintly demos!

We should try to follow what Igor's doing in aws so that we can learn what he's doing. That's what the demos are for!

Thinking of making a glossery document. Acronyms will be known!

Heading towards an internal sprint, and then after that we will plan the next one.

Next Week:
- Meeting minutes from our internal review.
